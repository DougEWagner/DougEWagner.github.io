		<p> After completing my undergraduate degree at McGill University with a major in History and a minor in Economics last May, it took me a long time to decide in which direction to head next. Not because I'm indecisive, but because the idea of a narrow trajectory is not one I am comfortable with. After brief flirtations with Finance and Journalism, I realized the launching-pad with the most diverse and complex future was in Tech. </p>

		<p> Currently learning all I can about the marketing space, from SEO and Social Media, to Adwords and Analytics. On the beginning of a long road towards becoming a <a ref="http://whyfiles.org/2013/mining-data/">Big Data</a> miner. Eventually, I'll help see a product from its birth all the way to the end. </p>
