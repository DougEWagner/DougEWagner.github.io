		<p> After completing my undergraduate degree at McGill University with a major in History and a minor in Economics last May, it took me a long time to decide in which direction to head next. Not because I'm indecisive, but because the idea of a narrow trajectory is not one I am comfortable with. After brief flirtations with Finance and Journalism, I realized the launching-pad with the most diverse and complex future was in Tech. </p>

		<p> What I lack in experience I make up for in intellectual curiosity. I have learned just enough about the Tech space to understand how little of it I've seen and experienced. I plan on using my time at the Startup Institute to find my bearings, hone the skills I have, and find new ones so interesting that I simply must acquire them. As a big admirer of the type of culture propagated by the industry, I look forward to joining a cohesive team at the bottom and learning how to add value as efficiently as possible. Eventually, I want to help build something from beginning to end. </p>
